# PHYSICS
2D spehere physics simulation. When you run it, click and move the cursor in the direction you want the 2D sphere to go, to let it go press space. After 3 second if the sphere is static it will dissappear. These simulation has wind, gravity, drag, friction with context and with other spheres. Finally if you want more juice on your spheres check (or uncheck otherwise) to disable drag and the spheres will move faster. Finally, don't click outside the box sometimes it breaks everything :( . 
## Known issues
I think there is a memory allocation problem because sometimes the z component of the simulation differs from 0.0f. But i think it has very low probabilities to happen. Warnedd.
